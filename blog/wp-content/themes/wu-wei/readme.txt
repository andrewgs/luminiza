About

Wu Wei is a Wordpress theme that was created with clean, modern, minimalism in mind. Information is presented in a logical manner, without any superfluous elements getting in the way. Just like the Taoist concept of wu wei, it’s knowing when to act, and knowing when not to act.


Features:

    Wordpress 3.0+ compatible
    Two colours schemes (light and dark)
    Widget enabled sidebar (or in this case, a bottom bar)
    Supports threaded comments
    SEO Optimized
    Validates as XHTML Strict and CSS Level 2.1
    Renders correctly in most major browsers. (Tested in Firefox 4+, Internet Explorer 8.0, Safari 5.0, and Google Chrome).
    GPL-licensed


Installation

Wu Wei is installed like a regular Wordpress theme: upload the entire wu-wei folder to your wp-content/themes directory. Then login into the Wordpress administration panel, go to “Themes” link under “Appearance”, and activate Wu Wei. If you have any trouble, you can use the instructions in the Wordpress codex here.


Special Formatting

This theme is based on principles of a grid system. You can break out of the grid with css declarations “pull-1” and “pull-2”. For images bigger than the main column, use the style declaration style="max-width:700px;".

You can also change the colour scheme of Wu Wei, by going to the “Theme Options” link under the “Appearance” section of the Wordpress administration panel. The default is “light”.

Special Thanks

This theme is dedicated to Michael Babin, my devoted and modest Tai Chi Chuan teacher, who helps me improve myself every week, and, using Tai Chi applications, continues to teach me to be patient and follow the principle of wu wei.

And a big thank you to you for using Wu Wei!
